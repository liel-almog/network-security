# DNS Assignment

### Exercise 1
Please enter to the container shell using `docker exec -it dns-auth-srv /bin/bash` and then run `chown root:root /var/cache/bind/dump.db`
in order to change the ownership of the `/var/cache/bind/dump.db` file so we can dump the DNS entries.

In addition please make sure that the folders have the right permission.
